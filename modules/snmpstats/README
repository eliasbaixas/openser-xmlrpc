Chapter 1. User's Guide

1.1. Overview

   The SNMPStats module provides an SNMP management interface to
   OpenSER. Specifically, it provides general SNMP queryable
   scalar statistics, table representations of more complicated
   data such as user and contact information, and alarm monitoring
   capabilities.
     __________________________________________________________

1.1.1. General Scalar Statistics

   The SNMPStats module provides a number of general scalar
   statistics. Details are available in OPENSER-MIB,
   OPENSER-REG-MIB, OPENSER-SIP-COMMON-MIB, and
   OPENSER-SIP-SERVER-MIB. But briefly, these scalars are:

   openserSIPProtocolVersion, openserSIPServiceStartTime,
   openserSIPEntityType, openserSIPSummaryInRequests,
   openserSIPSummaryOutRequest, openserSIPSummaryInResponses,
   openserSIPSummaryOutResponses,
   openserSIPSummaryTotalTransactions,
   openserSIPCurrentTransactions, openserSIPNumUnsupportedUris,
   openserSIPNumUnsupportedMethods,
   openserSIPOtherwiseDiscardedMsgs, openserSIPProxyStatefulness
   openserSIPProxyRecordRoute, openserSIPProxyAuthMethod,
   openserSIPNumProxyRequireFailures,
   openserSIPRegMaxContactExpiryDuration, openserSIPRegMaxUsers,
   openserSIPRegCurrentUsers, openserSIPRegDfltRegActiveInterval,
   openserSIPRegAcceptedRegistrations,
   openserSIPRegRejectedRegistrations, openserMsgQueueDepth.
   openserCurNumDialogs, openserCurNumDialogsInProgress,
   openserCurNumDialogsInSetup, openserTotalNumFailedDialogSetups

   There are also scalars associated with alarms. They are as
   follows:

   openserMsgQueueMinorThreshold, openserMsgQueueMajorThreshold,
   openserMsgQueueDepthAlarmStatus,
   openserMsgQueueDepthMinorAlarm, openserMsgQueueDepthMajorAlarm,
   openserDialogLimitMinorThreshold,
   openserDialogLimitMajorThreshold, openserDialogUsageState,
   openserDialogLimitAlarmStatus, openserDialogLimitMinorAlarm,
   openserDialogLimitMajorAlarm
     __________________________________________________________

1.1.2. SNMP Tables

   The SNMPStats module provides several tables, containing more
   complicated data. The current available tables are:

   openserSIPPortTable, openserSIPMethodSupportedTable,
   openserSIPStatusCodesTable, openserSIPRegUserTable,
   openserSIPContactTable, openserSIPRegUserLookupTable
     __________________________________________________________

1.1.3. Alarm Monitoring

   If enabled, the SNMPStats module will monitor for alarm
   conditions. Currently, there are two alarm types defined.

    1. The number of active dialogs has passed a minor or major
       threshold. The idea is that a network operation centre can
       be made aware that their SIP servers may be overloaded,
       without having to explicitly check for this condition.
       If a minor or major condition has occured, then a
       openserDialogLimitMinorEvent trap or a
       openserDialogLimitMajorEvent trap will be generated,
       respectively. The minor and major thresholds are described
       in the parameters section below.
    2. The number of bytes waiting to be consumed across all of
       OpenSERs listening ports has passed a minor or major
       threshold. The idea is that a network operation centre can
       be made aware that a machine hosting a SIP server may be
       entering a degraded state, and to investigate why this is
       so.
       If the number of bytes to be consumed passes a minor or
       major threshold, then a openserMsgQueueDepthMinorEvent or
       openserMsgQueueDepthMajorEvent trap will be sent out,
       respectively.

   Full details of these traps can be found in the distributions
   OPENSER-MIB file.
     __________________________________________________________

1.2. How it works

1.2.1. How the SNMPStats module gets its data

   The SNMPStats module uses OpenSERs internal statistic framework
   to collect most of its data. However, there are two exceptions.

    1. The openserSIPRegUserTable and openserSIPContactTable rely
       on the usrloc modules callback system. Specifically, the
       SNMPStats module will receive callbacks whenever a
       user/contact is added to the system.
    2. The SNMPStats modules openserSIPMsgQueueDepthMinorEvent and
       openserSIPMsgQueueDepthMajorEvent alarms rely on the
       OpenSER core to find out what interfaces, ports, and
       transports OpenSER is listening on. However, the module
       will actually query the proc file system to find out the
       number of bytes waiting to be consumed. (Currently, this
       will only work on systems providing the proc file system).
     __________________________________________________________

1.2.2. How data is moved from the SNMPStats module to a NOC

   We have now explained how the SNMPStats module gathers its
   data. We still have not explained how it exports this data to a
   NOC (Network Operations Centre), or administrator.

   The SNMPStats module expects to connect to a Master Agent. This
   would be a NetSNMP daemon running either on the same system as
   the OpenSER instance, or on another system. (Communication can
   take place over TCP, so there is no restriction that this
   daemon need be on the same system as OpenSER).

   If the master agent is unavailable when OpenSER first starts
   up, the SNMPStats module will continue to run. However, you
   will not be able to query it. Thankfully, the SNMPStats module
   continually looks for its master agent. So even if the master
   agent is started late, or if the link to the SNMPStats module
   is severed due to a temporary hardware failure or crashed and
   restarted master agent, the link will eventually be
   re-established. No data should be lost, and querying can begin
   again.

   To request for this data, you will need to query the master
   agent. The master agent will then redirect the request to the
   SNMPStats module, which will respond to the master agent, which
   will in turn respond to your request.
     __________________________________________________________

1.3. Dependencies

1.3.1. OpenSER Modules

   The SNMPStats module provides a plethora of statistics, some of
   which are collected by other modules. If the dependent modules
   are not loaded then those specific statistics will still be
   returned, but with zeroed values. All other statistics will
   continue to function normally. This means that the SNMPStats
   module has no hard/mandatory dependencies on other modules.
   There are however, soft dependencies, as follows:

     * usrloc - all scalars and tables relating to users and
       contacts are dependent on the usrloc module. If the module
       is not loaded, the respective tables will be empty.
     * dialog - all scalars relating to the number of dialogs are
       dependent on the presence of the dialog module.
       Furthermore, if the module is not loaded, then the
       openserDialogLimitMinorEvent, and
       openserDialogLimitMajorEvent alarm will be disabled.

   The contents of the openserSIPMethodSupportedTable change
   depending on which modules are loaded.
     __________________________________________________________

1.3.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSER with this module loaded:

     * NetSNMP v5.3 or greater - NetSNMP must be around at the
       time of compilation. Furthermore, there are several shared
       objects that must be loadable at the time SNMPStats is
       loaded. This means that NetSNMP must be installed (but not
       necessarily running) on the system that has loaded the
       SNMPStats module. (Details can be found in the compilation
       section below).
     __________________________________________________________

1.4. Exported Parameters

1.4.1. sipEntityType (String)

   This parameter describes the entity type for this OpenSER
   instance, and will be used in determining what is returned for
   the openserSIPEntityType scalar. Valid parameters are:

   registrarServer, redirectServer, proxyServer, userAgent, other

   Example 1-1. Setting the sipEntityType parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "sipEntityType", "registrarServer")
modparam("snmpstats", "sipEntityType", "proxyServer")
...

   Note that as the above example shows, you can define this
   parameter more than once. This is of course because a given
   OpenSER instance can take on more than one role.
     __________________________________________________________

1.4.2. MsgQueueMinorThreshold (Integer)

   The SNMPStats module monitors the number of bytes waiting to be
   consumed by OpenSER. If the number of bytes waiting to be
   consumed exceeds a minor threshold, the SNMPStats module will
   send out an openserMsgQueueDepthMinorEvent trap to signal that
   an alarm condition has occured. The minor threshold is set with
   the MsgQueueMinorThreshold parameter.

   Example 1-2. Setting the MsgQueueMinorThreshold parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "MsgQueueMinorThreshold", 2000)
...

   If this parameter is not set, then there will be no minor alarm
   monitoring.
     __________________________________________________________

1.4.3. MsgQueueMajorThreshold (Integer)

   The SNMPStats module monitors the number of bytes waiting to be
   consumed by OpenSER. If the number of bytes waiting to be
   consumed exceeds a major threshold, the SNMPStats module will
   send out an openserMsgQueueDepthMajorEvent trap to signal that
   an alarm condition has occured. The major threshold is set with
   the MsgQueueMajorThreshold parameter.

   Example 1-3. Setting the MsgQueueMajorThreshold parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "MsgQueueMajorThreshold", 5000)
...

   If this parameter is not set, then there will be no major alarm
   monitoring.
     __________________________________________________________

1.4.4. dlg_minor_threshold (Integer)

   The SNMPStats module monitors the number of active dialogs. If
   the number of active dialogs exceeds a minor threshold, the
   SNMPStats module will send out an openserDialogLimitMinorEvent
   trap to signal that an alarm condition has occured. The minor
   threshold is set with the dlg_minor_threshold parameter.

   Example 1-4. Setting the dlg_minor_threshold parameter
...
  modparam("snmpstats", "dlg_minor_threshold", 500)
...

   If this parameter is not set, then there will be no minor alarm
   monitoring.
     __________________________________________________________

1.4.5. dlg_major_threshold (Integer)

   The SNMPStats module monitors the number of active dialogs. If
   the number of active dialogs exceeds a major threshold, the
   SNMPStats module will send out an openserDialogLimitMajorEvent
   trap to signal that an alarm condition has occured. The major
   threshold is set with the dlg_major_threshold parameter.

   Example 1-5. Setting the dlg_major_threshold parameter
...
  modparam("snmpstats", "dlg_major_threshold", 750)
...

   If this parameter is not set, then there will be no major alarm
   monitoring.
     __________________________________________________________

1.4.6. snmpgetPath (String)

   The SNMPStats module provides the openserSIPServiceStartTime
   scalar. This scalar requires the SNMPStats module to perform a
   snmpget query to the master agent. You can use this parameter
   to set the path to your instance of NetSNMP's snmpget program.

   Default value is "/usr/local/bin/".

   Example 1-6. Setting the snmpgetPath parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "snmpgetPath",     "/my/custom/path/")
...
     __________________________________________________________

1.4.7. snmpCommunity (String)

   The SNMPStats module provides the openserSIPServiceStartTime
   scalar. This scalar requires the SNMPStats module to perform a
   snmpget query to the master agent. If you have defined a custom
   community string for the snmp daemon, you need to specify it
   with this parameter.

   Default value is "public".

   Example 1-7. Setting the snmpCommunity parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "snmpCommunity", "customCommunityString")
...
     __________________________________________________________

1.5. Exported Functions

   Currently, there are no exported functions.
     __________________________________________________________

1.6. Installation & Running

   There are several things that need to be done to get the
   SNMPStats module compiled and up and running.
     __________________________________________________________

1.6.1. Compiling the SNMPStats Module

   In order for the SNMPStats module to compile, you will need at
   least version 5.3 of the NetSNMP source code. The source can be
   found at:
    http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/

   For the specifics of installing NetSNMP, please see the INSTALL
   document in the root of the NetSNMP source package.

   The SNMPStats modules makefile requires that the NetSNMP script
   "net-snmp-config" can run. At a minimum, running
   "net-snmp-config --agent-libs" from the OpenSER source
   directory should return something similar to:
    -L/usr/local/lib -lnetsnmpmibs -lnetsnmpagent -lnetsnmphelpers -lnet
snmp

   The specifics of what is returned depends on how the system was
   configured. If your NetSNMP installation was installed from an
   RPM (or another packaged version), then there is a good chance
   that net-snmp-config will return something unecessarily longer.
   It is highly recommended you install NetSNMP from source to
   avoid bringing in excessive dependencies to the SNMPStats
   module.
     __________________________________________________________

1.6.2. Configuring NetSNMP to allow connections from the SNMPStats
module.

   The SNMPStats module will communicate with the NetSNMP Master
   Agent. This communication happens over a protocol known as
   AgentX. This means that NetSNMP must have been compiled with
   AgentX support. This will always be the case when you are
   compiling from source unless you explicitly removed AgentX
   support with ./configure.

   After AgentX support has been compiled into NetSNMP, its
   configuration file needs to be changed to turn on AgentX
   support. The exact location of the configuration file
   (snmpd.conf) may vary depending on your system. On my system,
   it is located in:
    /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpd.conf.

   At the very end of the file add the following line:
    master agentx

   The line tells NetSNMP to act as an AgentX master agent, so
   that it can accept connections from sub-agents such as the
   SNMPStats module.

   There is still one last step. Even though we have compiled and
   configured NetSNMP to have AgentX support, we still need to
   tell the daemon which interface and port to listen to for
   AgentX connections. This is done when the daemon is started as
   follows:
    snmpd -x mySystemName:PortNumber

   On my system, I start the NetSNMP daemon with:
    snmpd -x localhost:705

   This tells NetSNMP to act as a master agent, listening on the
   localhost interface at port 705.
     __________________________________________________________

1.6.3. Configuring the SNMPStats module for communication with a
Master Agent

   The previous section explained how to set up a NetSNMP master
   agent to accept AgentX connections. We now need to tell the
   SNMPStats module how to communicate with this master agent.
   This is done by giving the SNMPStats module its own NetSNMP
   configuration file. The file must be named snmpstats.conf, and
   must be in the same folder as the snmpd.conf file that was
   configured above. On my system this would be:
    /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpstats.conf

   The default configuration file included with the distribution
   can be used, and contains the following:
    agentXSocket tcp:localhost:705

   The above line tells the SNMPStats module to register with the
   master agent on the localhost, port 705. The parameters should
   match up with the snmpd process. Note that the master agent
   (snmpd) does not need to be present on the same machine as
   OpenSER. localhost could be replaced with any other machine.
     __________________________________________________________

1.6.4. Testing for a proper Configuration

   As a quick test to make sure that the SNMPStats module
   sub-agent can succesfully connect to the NetSNMP Master agent,
   start snmpd with the following:
    snmpd -f -Dagentx -x localhost:705 2>&1 | less

   You should see something similar to the following:
    No log handling enabled - turning on stderr logging
    registered debug token agentx, 1
    ...
    Turning on AgentX master support.
    agentx/master: initializing...
    agentx/master: initializing...   DONE
    NET-SNMP version 5.3.1

   Now, start up OpenSER in another window. In the snmpd window,
   you should see a bunch of:
    agentx/master: handle pdu (req=0x2c58ebd4,trans=0x0,sess=0x0)
    agentx/master: open 0x81137c0
    agentx/master: opened 0x814bbe0 = 6 with flags = a0
    agentx/master: send response, stat 0 (req=0x2c58ebd4,trans=0x0,sess=
0x0)
    agentx_build: packet built okay

   The messages beginning with "agentx" are debug messages stating
   that something is happening with an AgentX sub-agent, appearing
   because of the -Dagentx snmpd switch. The large number of debug
   messages appear at startup as the SNMPStats module registers
   all of its scalars and tables with the Master Agent. If you
   receive these messages, then SNMPStats module and NetSNMP
   daemon have both been configured correctly.

   3.1. Where can I find more about SNMP?
   3.2. Where can I find more about NetSNMP?
   3.3. Where can I find out more about AgentX?
   3.4. Why am I not receiving any SNMP Traps?
   3.5. OpenSER refuses to load the SNMPStats module. Why is it
          displaying "load_module: could not open module
          snmpstats.so"?

   3.6. How can I learn what all the scalars and tables are?
   3.7. Why do snmpget, snmpwalk, and snmptable always time out?
   3.8. How do I use snmpget?
   3.9. How do I use snmptable?
   3.10. Where can I find more about OpenSER?
   3.11. Where can I post a question about this module?
   3.12. How can I report a bug?

   3.1. Where can I find more about SNMP?

   There are many websites that explain SNMP at all levels of
   detail. A great general introduction can be found at
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNMP If you are interested in the
   nitty gritty details of the protocol, then please look at RFC
   3410. RFC 3410 maps out the many other RFCs that define SNMP,
   and can be found at
   http://www.rfc-archive.org/getrfc.php?rfc=3410

   3.2. Where can I find more about NetSNMP?

   NetSNMP source code, documentation, FAQs, and tutorials can all
   be found at http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/.

   3.3. Where can I find out more about AgentX?

   The full details of the AgentX protocol are explained in RFC
   2741, available at:
   http://www.rfc-archive.org/getrfc.php?rfc=2741

   3.4. Why am I not receiving any SNMP Traps?

   Assuming you've configured the trap thresholds in openser.cfg
   with something similar to:
    modparam("snmpstats", "MsgQueueMinorThreshold", 1234)
    modparam("snmpstats", "MsgQueueMajorThreshold", 5678)

    modparam("snmpstats", "dlg_minor_threshold", 500)
    modparam("snmpstats", "dlg_minor_threshold", 600)

   Then either OpenSER is not reaching these thresholds (which is
   a good thing), or you haven't set up the trap monitor
   correctly. To prove this to yourself, you can start NetSNMP
   with:
    snmpd -f -Dtrap -x localhost:705

   The -f tells the NetSNMP process to not daemonize, and the
   -Dtrap enables trap debug logs. You should see something
   similar to the following:
    registered debug token trap, 1
    trap: adding callback trap sink            ----- You should see both
    trapsess: adding to trap table             ----- of these lines.
    Turning on AgentX master support.
    trap: send_trap 0 0 NET-SNMP-TC::linux
    trap: sending trap type=167, version=1
    NET-SNMP version 5.3.1

   If the two lines above did not appear, then you probably have
   not included the following in your snmpd.conf file.
    trap2sink machineToSendTrapsTo:machinesPortNumber.

   When a trap has been received by snmpd, the following will
   appear in the above output:
    sent_trap -1 -1 NET-SNMP-TC::linus
    sending trap type=167, version=1

   You'll also need a program to collect the traps and do
   something with them (such as sending them to syslog). NetSNMP
   provides snmptrapd for this. Other solutions exist as well.
   Google is your friend.

   3.5. OpenSER refuses to load the SNMPStats module. Why is it
   displaying "load_module: could not open module snmpstats.so"?

   On some systems, you may receive the following error at stdout
   or the log files depending on the configuration.
    ERROR: load_module: could not open module </usr/local/lib/openser/mo
dules/snmpstats.so>:
           libnetsnmpmibs.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such
 file or directory.

   This means one of two things:

    1. You did not install NetSNMP. ("make install" if building
       from source)
    2. The dynamic linker cannot find the necessary libraries.

   In the second case, the fix is as follows:

    1. find / -name "libnetsnmpmibs*"
          + You will find a copy unless you haven't installed
            NetSNMP. Make note of the path.
    2. less /etc/ld.so.conf
          + If the file is missing the path from step 1, then add
            the path to ld.so.conf
    3. ldconfig
    4. Try starting OpenSER again.

   Alternatively, you may prefix your startup command with:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/noted/in/step/one/above

   For example, on my system I ran:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib openserctl start

   3.6. How can I learn what all the scalars and tables are?

   All scalars and tables are named in the SNMPStats module
   overview. The files OPENSER-MIB, OPENSER-REG-MIB,
   OPENSER-SIP-COMMON-MIB and OPENSER-SIP-SERVER-MIB contain the
   full definitions and descriptions. Note however, that the MIBs
   may actually contain scalars and tables which are currently not
   provided by the SNMPStats module. Therefore, it is better to
   use NetSNMP's snmptranslate as an alternative. Take the
   openserSIPEntityType scalar as an example. You can invoke
   snmptranslate as follows:
    snmptranslate -TBd openserSIPEntityType

   Which would result in something similar to the following:
    -- FROM       OPENSER-SIP-COMMON-MIB
    -- TEXTUAL CONVENTION OpenSERSIPEntityRole
    SYNTAX        BITS {other(0), userAgent(1), proxyServer(2), redirect
Server(3), registrarServer(4)}
    MAX-ACCESS    read-only
    STATUS        current
    DESCRIPTION   " This object identifies the list of SIP entities this
                   row is related to. It is defined as a bit map.  Each
                   bit represents a type of SIP entity.
                   If a bit has value 1, the SIP entity represented by
                   this row plays the role of this entity type.

                   If a bit has value 0, the SIP entity represented by
                   this row does not act as this entity type
                   Combinations of bits can be set when the SIP entity
                   plays multiple SIP roles."

   3.7. Why do snmpget, snmpwalk, and snmptable always time out?

   If your snmp operations are always returning with: "Timeout: No
   Response from localhost", then chances are that you are making
   the query with the wrong community string. Default installs
   will most likely use "public" as their default community
   strings. Grep your snmpd.conf file for the string
   "rocommunity", and use the result as your community string in
   your queries.

   3.8. How do I use snmpget?

   NetSNMP's snmpget is used as follows:
    snmpget -v 2c -c theCommunityString machineToSendTheMachineTo scalar
Element.0

   For example, consider an snmpget on the openserSIPEntityType
   scalar, run on the same machine running the OpenSER instance,
   with the default "public" community string. The command would
   be:
    snmpget -v2c -c public localhost openserSIPEntityType.0

   Which would result in something similar to:
    OPENSER-SIP-COMMON-MIB::openserSIPEntityType.0 = BITS: F8 \
                other(0) userAgent(1) proxyServer(2)          \
                redirectServer(3) registrarServer(4)

   3.9. How do I use snmptable?

   NetSNMP's snmptable is used as follows:
    snmptable -Ci -v 2c -c theCommunityString machineToSendTheMachineTo
theTableName

   For example, consider the openserSIPRegUserTable. If we run the
   snmptable command on the same machine as the running OpenSER
   instance, configured with the default "public" community
   string. The command would be:
    snmptable -Ci -v 2c -c public localhost openserSIPRegUserTable

   Which would result in something similar to:
    index openserSIPUserUri openserSIPUserAuthenticationFailures
        1       DefaultUser                                    0
        2            bogdan                                    0
