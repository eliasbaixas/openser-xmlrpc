	    <para> 
	      The module does specific handling for notify-subscribe
	      message-summary (message waiting indication) events
	      as specified in RFC 3842.
	      It is used with the general event handling module,
   	      presence. It constructs and adds message-summary event to
  	      it.
	    </para>
	    <para>
 	      The module does not currently implement any authorization
	      rules.  It assumes that publish requests are only issued by
	      a voicemail application and subscribe requests only by
	      the owner of voicemail box.  Authorization can thus
	      be easily done by &ser; configuration file before
	      calling handle_publish() and handle_subscribe()
	      functions.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The module implements a simple check of content type
	      application/simple-message-summary:  Content must start
	      with Messages-Waiting status line followed by zero or
	      more lines that consist of tabs and printable ASCII
	      characters.
